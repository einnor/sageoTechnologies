In 60 BC Caesar's career took him back to Spain. Aged 41, he was awarded the post of praetor. It may well have been that the senate decided to send the young upstart to a troubled region, in order to have him fail.
Trouble had been brewing with the local tribes in Spain for a long time. But Caesar undaunted by the problems, excelled in his new role.
Caesar discovered a talent for military command which he himself hadn't known he possessed. The experience he gained in Spain would be of great value in his further career. But more so the ability of capturing some spoils of war for himself, to put his personal finances back to right and repay his debt was what rescued his career.
If there was one lesson, Caesar learnt in Spain then it was that war could be politically and financially very profitable.
