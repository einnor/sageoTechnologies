Meanwhile the regime in Rome had changed and Caesar could return home.
Based on his deeds and military achievements so far, Caesar successfully campaigned for a post in the Roman administration. Caesar served in 63 BC as a quaestor in Spain, where in Cadiz he is said to have broken down and wept in front of a statue of Alexander the Great, realizing that where Alexander had conquered most of the known world at thirty, Caesar at that age was merely seen as a dandy who had squandered his wife's fortunes as well as his own.

Caesar returned to Rome, determined to achieve political standing. His first wife had died, so Caesar once more entered into a politically useful marriage.
Though he divorced his new wife soon afterwards, on suspicion of adultery. The suspicion was unproven and friends urged him to show greater faith in his wife. But Caesar declared that he could not live with a woman even suspected of adultery.
There was some truth in that statement. His enemies were only waiting to ruin him, seeking any chance to exploit a weakness, no matter if true or not.

For the next years, Caesar continued to buy popularity, both with the people of Rome as well as with the high and mighty in important places. Achieving the post of aedile, Caesar used it to his fullest advantage.
Bribes, public shows, gladiatorial contests, games and banquets; Caesar employed them all - at huge costs - to buy favour.
'He showed himself perfectly prepared to serve and flatter everybody, even ordinary people... and he did not mind temporarily grovelling' (quote by Dio Cassius)
But he also acted, as was usual for an aedile to renovate public buildings, which naturally also impressed some of the less fickle part of the populace.

Caesar well knew that his actions were costing him fortunes. And some of his creditors were calling in their debts.
Furthermore, many senators were beginning to dislike this brash newcomer who in the most undignified fashion was bribing his way up the political ladder.
But Caesar cared little and bribed his way into the office of pontifex maximus (chief priest).
This new office bestowed upon Caesar not only the sheer status of a powerful position, but so too the post's dignity granted Caesar a solemn appearance which he otherwise would have struggled to attain.
Being a religious post it also made him sacrosanct as a person. The pontifex maximus a man very hard to criticize or attack in any way.
