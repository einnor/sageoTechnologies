 And so Caesar left Rome to join the army. Naturally, as a member of a patrician family, he didn't enter the forces as a common soldier. His first posting was as a military assistant to a provincial governor.
Thereafter he was posted to Cilicia, where he proved himself a capable and courageous soldier, winning praise for having saved the life of a comrade.
It's believed that his next assignment was in one of the armies which crushed Spartacus' slave rebellion.

After this Caesar left the army, yet it was still considered unwise for him to return to Rome.
Instead he spent some time in the south of Italy improving his education, in particular rhetoric. Caesar later proved an incredibly talented, if not genial, public speaker and much of this will undoubtedly have come from his training in rhetoric.

'Do you know any man who, even if he has concentrated on the art of oratory to the exclusion of all else, can speak better than Caesar ?' (quote by Cicero).
Caesar decided to spend the winter on the island of Rhodes, but the ship taking him there was captured by pirates, who held him hostage for about forty days, until a large ransom bought his freedom.
During this misadventure Caesar displayed much of the ruthlessness which should later lead to his world fame.
While captured he joked with his captors, telling them he'd see them all crucified, once he was released. Everyone laughed at the joke, even Caesar himself.
But it was in fact exactly what he did once he was released. He hunted the pirates down, captured them and had them crucified.

Caesar's next task was to organize a force to defend Roman property along the coast of Asia Minor (Turkey).
